# Design a payment system using stripe or paypal as payment gateway 

1. Centralized source of truth table that captures the payment data in secure way. So when customer
initiate a payment, app will store the request in RDMBS and starts the process.
2. Submit the request to Stripe or any PSP with a Idempotency key.
   - Idempotency key generation could be selecting some pre-created keys from DB.
   - Let client create one while loading up the payment page
3. Stripe takes a Webhook to call us back on completion or failure of payment.
4. On completion update the source of truth table with payment status.
5. Look for Pending payments with Stripe in regular interval after some time. Update back the ledger table.
   Below are the different status Stripe could come back with when asked for a pending transaction.
   - Stripe never heard of the transaction - delete from our ledger.
   - Stripe say payment was completed - update the ledger table with staus.
   - Stripe says payment in in_process - wait and do nothing.
6. Merchant reports - Use CDC mechanism.
   - When a transaction completes, ledger table could be followed by CDC to generate different kinds of    report.
